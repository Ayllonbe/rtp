# MICRO server


When I access in the server, I found me in /mnt/picea/home/aabenitez. First, I
access to my data folder and link the Seidr network file. Then, with seidr tool, I transform it 
in a txt file to be exported outside of the server.

> cd Git/data/
> mkdir drosophila
> cd drosophila
> ln -s  ln -s  /mnt/picea/projects/seidr/networks/dmel/results/aggregate/irp.bb.1.28.sf .
> module load bioinfo-tools
> module load seidr-devel
> seidr view -c irp.bb.1.28.sf > dmel_network.tsv
> exit

# LOCALHOST

First, I retrieve the files I need to my preprocessing analysis: The Seidr network in a txt format and the 
STRING file including the PPI with meaning links.

> scp micro:~/Git/data/drosophila/dmel_network.tsv .
> wget https://stringdb-static.org/download/protein.actions.v11.0/7227.protein.actions.v11.0.txt.gz

Then the ids for the STRING file represent proteins while the ids for the Seidr networks are genes. Therefore, we 
need to transform the protein id into gene id by using the mapping file downloaded from UniPROT:

> wget https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/idmapping/by_organism/DROME_7227_idmapping.dat.gz 

# RSTUDIO

There is a created R file called TransformingStringToEnsemble.R. This file have several steps:

1. To read DROME_7227_idmapping.dat.gz and create the STRING id 2 Ensemble id mapping.
2. To combine the created mapping with the STRING network with protein actions.
4. To transform the From and To columns as ensemble id
5. To export the new STRING network with the gene ids as dmel.protein.actions.v11.0.txt

# Python

There is a Python file called dmel-preprocessing.py that preprocess two files: dmel_network.tsv and 
dmel.protein.actions.v11.0.txt to generate a unique
