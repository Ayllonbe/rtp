
STRING only includes the PPI with annotated link of Populus trichocarpa. However, here we mostly use Populus
tremula. For that reason, we need to preprocess the results using the orthology between those close organisms.


# MICRO server


When I access in the server, I found me in /mnt/picea/home/aabenitez. First, I
access to my data folder and link the Seidr network file. Then, with seidr tool, I transform it 
in a txt file to be exported outside of the server.

> cd Git/data/
> mkdir potrav
> cd potrav
> ln -s /mnt/picea/projects/aspseq/nstreet/v2/network/full/results/aggregated.bb.sf .
> module load bioinfo-tools
> module load seidr-devel
> seidr view -c aggregated.bb.sf > potra_network.tsv
> exit

# LOCALHOST

First, I retrieve the files I need to my preprocessing analysis: The Seidr network in a txt format and the 
STRING file including the PPI with meaning links.

> scp micro:~/Git/data/potrav/potra_network.tsv .
> wget https://stringdb-static.org/download/protein.actions.v11.0/3694.protein.actions.v11.0.txt.gz
> mv 3694.protein.actions.v11.0.txt.gz potri.protein.actions.v11.0.txt.gz

Due to the fact that we are working with Populus tremula, we need to download the files to changes the potri 
links with the orthologues potra. Also, STRING file, only have the potri ids related with the V2 assembling,
therefore the mapping of the version 2 and version 3 is also need.

> wget ftp://plantgenie.org/Data/PopGenIE/Populus_tremula/v2.2/annotation/best_diamond/potra_potri_BEST_DIAMOND_out.tsv.gz
> wget ftp://plantgenie.org/Data/PopGenIE/Populus_trichocarpa/v3.0/v10.1/Annotation/id_conversion/potri_v3_v2.txt

## RSTUDIO

There is a created R file called stringTransPotriToPotra.R. This file have few steps:

1. To combine potra_potri_BEST_DIAMOND_out.tsv.gz and potri_v3_v2.txt to access from v2 potri to v3 potra.
2. To combine new mapping with potri.protein.actions.v11.0.txt.gz.
4. To transform the From and To columns as potra gene id
5. To export the new STRING network with the gene ids as potra.protein.actions.v11.0.txt

# Python

There is a Python file called potra-preprocessing.py that preprocess two files: potra_network.tsv and 
potra.protein.actions.v11.0.txt to generate a unique file combining their content.
